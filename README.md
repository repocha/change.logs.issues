### parsing change logs of software projects

For sw/sys research, we often needs to search the changes to understand significant improvements. This repo provides some simple parsers and kw-based selectors.

The idea is exactly the same as `commit.logs.x`.

Unfortunately, unlike commit logs that are generated by SCM tools like Git and SVN, change logs do not typically have a standard format. Therefore, it's likely we need to write parsers for each software we want to analyse.

On the other hand, after did two projects (httpd and squid), I find they share the same following format:
```
Changes to squid-3.4.7 (28 Aug 2014):
	- Regression Fix: Kerberos LDAP authorizing ...
	- Bug 4080: worker hangs when client ...
	- Bug 3966: Add KeyEncipherment when ...
	- HTTP/1.1: Ignore Range headers with ...
	- SSL-bump: Use v3 for fake certificate ...
    ...
Changes to squid-3.4.6 (25 Jun 2014):
    ...
```
Only the version notes and some seperators are different (if you look at `httpd/squid_parser.py` and `squid/squid_parser.py`, the code structures look exactly the same. Therefore, I guess we can build some abstractions. But let's wait until we are bored in writing these parsers.
